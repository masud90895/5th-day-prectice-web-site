                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Md. Mahafujur Rahaman Masud, and I’m a full-time front end developer with 1 years experience. In that time, I’ve worked as a front-end developer for both a Forbes 500 consulting firm and a small company. This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a degree in IT project management.</p>

                <h1>Hyderabadi Haleem Recipe</h1>
                <p>Haleem is a classic delicacy in the Indian subcontinent and middle east. With its roots in Persian cuisine, this savory porridge is now prepared in India with meat, wheat, lentil, spices and herbs.  It is somewhere between a stew and a soup in consistency; like the stoup referred to by Rachel Ray!</p>

                <h1>Veg Haleem</h1>
                <p>Today, we will see how to make vegetarian haleem. Veg haleem takes comparatively less time than the mutton/ chicken haleem. Lets see how to make beg haleem easily at home.For this recipe, I used 1 cup meal maker
                    Soya granules instead of meal maker could be used.
                    Firstly, lets boil them.
                    Heat 2-3 glasses of water in a pan.
                    Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and simmer.</p>
