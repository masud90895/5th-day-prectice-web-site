                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Md. Mahafujur Rahaman Masud, and I’m a full-time front end developer with 1 years experience. In that time, I’ve worked as a front-end developer for both a Forbes 500 consulting firm and a small company. This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a degree in IT project management.</p>
